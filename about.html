                <p>	Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi was born January 30, 1984, in Cleveland, Ohio. An American rapper and actor, his style of music has brought much attention to him and his popularity has sky rocketed. The new Cleveland style of rapping has also brought other up coming rappers into the industry such as Chip the Ripper.I chose Kid Cudi becasue his rap in the early 2008, similar to Kanye, continued to let people discuss their feelings. Kid Cuid's release of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/47y3PbX8oIDCkYAFylCJz0" target="_top">Man On the Moon</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2tVx9iCMyJRhtM6VUGGD2u" target="_top">Kid Named Cudi</a> created a reminder that artists are allowed to be unapologetic in their music. As people began buying their music legal and ilegally online, it made his situaion easier as an unsigned artist to release music. </p>
